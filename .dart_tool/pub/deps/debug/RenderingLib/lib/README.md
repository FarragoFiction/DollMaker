# DollLib
hopefully everything you need to render a doll made by the maker

work in progress.

IMPORTANT: TO MAKE THIS WORK YOU NEED TO COPY AND PASTE THE MANIFEST DIRECTORY UP TO THE SAME LEVEL AS THE CSS FOLDER. PL SAYS SO.
ALSO COPY AND PASTE THE IMAGES FOLDER INTO THE SAME LEVEL AS THE CSS DIRECTORY. IF IT ALREADY EXISTS, THEN JUST THE CONTENTS.
MAKE A CSS FOLDER IF NEEDED. CSS FOLDER SHOULD BE ON SAME LEVEL AS SCRIPTS FOLDER.

ALSO: WHEN YOU FIRST CHECK OUT A PROJECT THAT DEPENDS ON THIS, THE DOLLLIB DIRECTORY WILL
BY EMPTY. YOU'LL NEED TO CLONE IT MANUALLY INTO SCRIPTS. AND THEN WIRE EVERYTHING UP.

AND RE-GET DEPENDNENCIES AND RENABLE DART SUPPORT. NOT SURE WHY ON THAT ONE YET.
