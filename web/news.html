    <li>November 2nd, decided I should have a news section. Existing dolls will get a little bit broken, but needed to be able to have some glasses/accesories layers OVER the hair and not under it. You'll see what I mean.</li>
    <li><b>December 9th. Holy shit. I forgot this exited. Fuck. Uh. From now on I'll just let the wranglers remind me to write here, slash tell me what to write.</b></li>
    <li>+Hair. So much hair. <li>+Mouths. So many mouths. <li>+We still don't know where these body parts come from. They just show up and it's scaring us.
    <li>+Human's have reasonable color palettes instead of randomly generated nightmares.</li>
        <li>+More echeladder levels available.</li>
        <li>+We went to home depot and got a fuckton of new ladders. Knock yourselves out kids</li>
        <li>Shit ton of doll parts added, including dog ears.</li>
        <li>+We took the broken bodies away and put them where no one can find them.</li>
        <li>More parts. And        <a href="monster_pocket_index.html">Monster Pocket Maker by Frew</a>
        </li>12/27/17, Holy fuck, I finally got around to standardizing the doll page to the point where I only need ONE page to handle all dolls.<br><Br>
        This was needed because the saved dolls now include an 'edit' link instead of making you manually copy the save data and put it in the right url.
        <br><Br>
        <b>PAY ATTENTION TO THIS</b>: It will SEEM like your saved doll urls will be broken. This will not actually be true.
        I'm going to step you through converting them.
        <br><br>
        Your old URL will look like this:

        http://farragofiction.com/DollSim/troll_index.html?AiA7IDQ6IDQqECMhPCTcX2c3Pk7-10351005IDQCAABYWlrS0dGJiIgAAACIiIiYmZkhJiYGCBIEAAmqaWiwsGgAAADAwAAAACAEAAA=

        <br><Br>Maybe it will say "consort_index.html" maybe it will say "denizen_index.html". I don't care.
        <br><br>
        All you need to do is make it say index.html. Like this:
        <br><Br>
        http://farragofiction.com/DollSim/index.html?AiA7IDQ6IDQqECMhPCTcX2c3Pk7-10351005IDQCAABYWlrS0dGJiIgAAACIiIiYmZkhJiYGCBIEAAmqaWiwsGgAAADAwAAAACAEAAA=
        <br><Br>Got it?
