    <li>November 2nd, decided I should have a news section. Existing dolls will get a little bit broken, but needed to be able to have some glasses/accesories layers OVER the hair and not under it. You'll see what I mean.</li>
    <li><b>December 9th. Holy shit. I forgot this exited. Fuck. Uh. From now on I'll just let the wranglers remind me to write here, slash tell me what to write.</b></li>
    <li>+Hair. So much hair. <li>+Mouths. So many mouths. <li>+We still don't know where these body parts come from. They just show up and it's scaring us.
    <li>+Human's have reasonable color palettes instead of randomly generated nightmares.</li>
