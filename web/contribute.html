    <h3>Send sprite parts to jadedResearcher on tumbler, gmail or discord. All submitted sprites are assumed to be able to be used for dollmakers, sim work or derivative games.</h3>

    <p>The Dollmaker has particular requirements if you want your sprites to work. Test your parts <a href = "testParts.html">here</a></p>


    <h2>Colors</h2>
    <p><img src = 'images/Joe_Everycolor.png'>
        <br>First and foremost: COLORS ARE VERY IMPORTANT. Do not use colors outside of this pallete unless you want them to be unreplaced.</p>
    <div id = "palette"></div>

    <h2>Image Size</h2>
    <p> All doll parts are 400x300 pixels. YES even if it's something small like eyes. There will be a lot of empty space, this is normal.</p>

    <h2>Positioning</h2>
    <p>If you want something to be part of a layer, position it exactly where existing things are on that layer. Put your eyes where the eyes already are, for example.
    </p>
    <p>Things like hair and fins LOOK like a single layer but are actually multiple. Part of the hair/fin goes on top of the face, part behind.</p>
    <p>Here are example images for all layers. You can save these pictures and use them as guidelines for aligning parts.</p>
